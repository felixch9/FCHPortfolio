Felix's Portfolio: An Archaeologist in the Digital Age üèõÔ∏è‚û°Ô∏èüíª
Hey there! üëã You've found the source code for my personal portfolio website.

This project was a fun way for me to tell my professional story‚Äîthe journey from archaeological digs to digital systems. The whole idea was to build something that feels like me: clean, professional, and a little bit nerdy. It's a single index.html file built to be simple, fast, and effective.

‚ú® Features & Tech Stack
This isn't just a static page. I've included a few fun features to showcase my skills:

Dual-Theme Interface: A theme toggler in the top corner switches between a clean "Light Mode" (for the academic, fieldwork side) and a tech-inspired "Blueprint Mode" (for the digital, coding side). Your choice is saved in your browser for your next visit!

Interactive AI Tool: The "AI Artifact Analysis" is a live demo that uses the Gemini API to generate archaeological insights, directly blending my past experience with my current skills.

Animated Stats: The "Quantified Experience" numbers are animated with JavaScript to make the data more engaging.

Built With: This entire site is built with pure HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

A Personal Note on "Blueprint Mode"
Why a "Blueprint Mode"? I love the idea that both archaeology and coding are about understanding complex systems. One deals with the blueprints of past societies, and the other deals with the blueprints of digital applications. This theme was a fun way for me to connect those two worlds.
