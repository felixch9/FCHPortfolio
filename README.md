Personal Portfolio of Felix Collazo Helgeson
This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website.

About This Project
I built this site to serve as a clean, professional space to present my work and experience. It's a single index.html file that I use to practice my skills with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The goal was to create something simple and effective that tells my professional story. It's also a space where I can test new ideas and continue learning about web development and system integration.

Features
Dual-Theme Interface: A theme toggler switches between a clean "Light Mode" and a tech-inspired "Blueprint Mode."

Interactive AI Tool: The "AI Artifact Analysis" is a demonstration of how I can connect my background in archaeology with modern AI tools.

Built With: HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.
